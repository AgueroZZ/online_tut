For an overview of the sGP model and its computational methods, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09914).

`BayesGP`, available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesGP/index.html),efficiently implements Gaussian process priors (including the sGP) for a variety of Bayesian hierarchical models.

`sGPfit`, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AgueroZZ/sGPfit), is designed to help with more advanced applications of the sGP, including fitting the exact process via the state-space representation.


**Tutorials:**

These tutorials are organized progressively, starting with basic concepts and moving to more advanced topics. We recommend beginning with the first tutorial and proceeding in order.
