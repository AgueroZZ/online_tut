See [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09914) for an overview of the sGP model as well as its associated computational methods.

The package `BayesGP` is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesGP/index.html), which efficiently implements Gaussian process priors (including the sGP) for various Bayesian hierarchical models.

The package `sGPfit` is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AgueroZZ/sGPfit), which can be used for more advanced applications of the sGP prior, including fitting the exact process through the state-space representation.


**Tutorials:**

The tutorials are organized from more basic to more advanced. It is recommended to start with the first tutorial and proceed in order.
